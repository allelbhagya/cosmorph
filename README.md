# COSMORPH

**Data Preparation:**
- [ ] Gather high-resolution 2D images of space bodies.
- [ ] Preprocess the images to remove artifacts and enhance quality.

**Depth Estimation:**
- [ ] Research and choose a depth estimation technique (stereo vision, structure from motion, etc.).
- [ ] Implement the chosen technique to estimate depth from the 2D images.

**Point Cloud Generation:**
- [ ] Convert depth information into a 3D point cloud representation.
- [ ] Associate color information from the original images with each point.

**Mesh Generation:**
- [ ] Use algorithms (Delaunay triangulation or Marching Cubes) to create a mesh from the point cloud.

**Texture Mapping:**
- [ ] Apply the 2D images as textures onto the 3D model's surface to give it a visual appearance.

**3D Rendering Setup:**
- [ ] Set up a 3D rendering environment (OpenGL, WebGL) to display the 3D models.

**User Interaction:**
- [ ] Implement controls for user interaction (zoom, pan, rotate).
- [ ] Allow users to manipulate the 3D view using mouse, touch, or keyboard inputs.

**Real-time Rendering:**
- [ ] Optimize the rendering process to ensure smooth real-time interaction with the 3D model.

**Application Deployment:**
- [ ] Develop the application and ensure it runs smoothly on the chosen platform.

**Testing and Feedback:**
- [ ] Test the application thoroughly for bugs and performance issues.
- [ ] Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements.

**Documentation and Presentation:**
- [ ] Create documentation explaining the project's technical details and functionality.
- [ ] Prepare visuals and explanations for presenting the project to others.
